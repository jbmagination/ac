# Animal Crossing Music
Animal Crossing music for all games, depending on time, weather, and holiday.

This hasn't been created yet, but this repository will be here for documentation and for when it is finished and ready.

A lot of code has been stolen from [tane.us/ac](https://tane.us/ac) (regarding CSS), [crossingti.me](https://crossingti.me) (regarding playlists and videos), the [AC Music extension](https://acmusicext.com) (regarding when to loop, and some weather code) and Stack Overflow. Please don't sue me.

## Regarding main games
Animal Crossing for GameCube and Animal Forest for Nintendo 64 have the exact same music.

City Folk for Wii and Wild World for DS have the exact same music.

New Leaf has it's own individual music.

New Horizons music is also individual.

For unknown music tracks, comments on the videos will be used for guessing what hour it is.

K.K. Slider songs are off by default, but can be  enabled.
