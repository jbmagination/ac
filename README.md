# Animal Crossing Music
Animal Crossing music for all games, depending on time, weather, and holiday.

This hasn't been created yet, but this repository will be here for documentation and for when it is finished and ready.

A lot of code has been stolen from [tane.us/ac](https://tane.us/ac) and [crossingti.me](https://crossingti.me). Mine expands on it to include the weather and holiday, other games, etc.

## Regarding main games
Animal Crossing for GameCube and Animal Forest for Nintendo 64 have the exact same music.

City Folk for Wii and Wild World for DS have the exact same music.

Some of New Horizons music has been leaked. Until it comes out officially, the trailer theme will play for hours that haven't been leaked yet. Keep in mind some of New Horizons music will be extremely low quality.

For unknown music tracks, comments on the videos will be used for guessing what hour it is.

## Regarding other games
Happy Home Designer will play the music of your choice for day and night cycles. Weather and holidays are not considered in this game.

Pocket Camp I'm still working out.

amiibo Festival will play music by weather and holiday. Time is not considered in this game.
