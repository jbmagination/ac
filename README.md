# Animal Crossing Music
Animal Crossing music for all games, depending on time, weather, and holiday.

This hasn't been created yet, but this repository will be here for documentation and for when it is finished and ready.

A lot of code has been stolen from [tane.us/ac](https://tane.us/ac) (regarding CSS), [crossingti.me](https://crossingti.me) (regarding playlists and videos), the [AC Music extension](https://acmusicext.com) (regarding when to loop, and some weather code) and Stack Overflow. Please don't sue me.

I am sincerely hoping this will be the most feature-rich choice for Animal Crossing music yet.

## Regarding main games
Animal Crossing for GameCube and Animal Forest for Nintendo 64 have the exact same music.

City Folk for Wii and Wild World for DS have the exact same music.

New Leaf has it's own individual music.

New Horizons music is also individual.

K.K. Slider songs are off by default, but can be enabled.

## Regarding other games
Happy Home Designer will play the music of your choice for day and night cycles. Weather and holidays are not considered in this game.

Pocket Camp I'm still working out.

amiibo Festival will play music by weather and holiday. Time is not considered in this game.
